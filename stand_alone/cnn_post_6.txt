(CNN)Amid the dramatic turbulence in international markets, triggered above all else by Trump's trade war with China, the eurozone economy looks like one of the few solid cornerstones of the global financial system.

Despite an unsolved debt crisis in Italy, the world's second most powerful currency, behind the dollar, appears robust and ready to go after nearly a decade of crisis management and reforms.
But that calm and outward vitality could well be illusory, as was the long period of stability between the euro's introduction -- first as common accounting currency in 1999 and then in note and coin form in 2002 -- and the onset of the European debt crisis in late 2009.
Ultimately, the monetary union still bears many of the fundamental structural flaws that it was born with, which could well undermine the currency again, should crisis hit as unexpectedly as it did ten years ago.
